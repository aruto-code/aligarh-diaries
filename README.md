## Problem Statement

<ul>
<li>
We have city websites like "Nagar Nigam" that provide us with daily updates on what's happening in the city and a wealth of information about it, but these websites still lack several crucial features that would enable any user to fix an issue in the region where they currently reside.
</li>
<li>
Also we discovered, having numerous apps for various daily tasks, such as paying bills, reading the news, and so forth, not only takes up more space on our devices, but also complicates task management for individual apps. By combining all of the applications in one location with some additional cutting-edge features, we have came up with a solution <b>"Aligarh Diaries"</b>.
</li>
</ul>

## What we did?

Our project gives a general picture of our beautiful city Aligarh and how it is developing into a smart city. Also, our project can evaluate different locations to see if they are smart or not, and residents can provide input on specific areas they live in. This project comprises a tourist guide that lists classy locations to visit, as well as a "about" part, a dashboard for citizens, and a feedback option.
